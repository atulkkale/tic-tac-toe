# Tik Tac Toe

A simple and interactive Tik Tac Toe game built with **React**. This project allows two players to enjoy a classic game with added features like custom player names and turn indicators.

## Features

- **Customizable player names**: Players can change their names.
- **Turn indicator**: The active player's name is highlighted to show whose turn it is.
- **Game results**: A modal pops up at the end of the game, announcing the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset button**: The pop-up includes a button to reset the game and start over immediately.

## Technologies Used

- **React**

## How to Play

1. Enter custom names for Player 1 and Player 2 (optional).
2. Player 1 (X) starts the game by clicking on a square.
3. Players take turns clicking on the board squares.
4. The game ends when:
   - A player gets three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal (winner is declared).
   - All squares are filled without a winner (game ends in a draw).
5. A modal will pop up at the end of the game with the result.
